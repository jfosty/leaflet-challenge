# Leaflet Challenge 

In this challenge, we are creating a map visualization that shows the magnitude of an earthquake based on the size of the dot. The location and depth is als representated on the map. 

As with javascript sites, there are several files within the repository that allow the map to work. 
  - Index.html: Is the actual site hoster. There is code within that slots in the javascript, css file to render the map.
  - Within the Static folder, we have the logic.js which does the majority of the work with pulling in the data from the US geological survey, it adds the layer of the map, plots the points and sizes, colors them correctly, adds a legend, etc.
  - Within the staic folder, there is also a style.css file which helps render the map.  

I used github's pages function to create this as an actual webpage that anyone can visit here: https://jfosty.github.io/leaflet-challenge/. 


Have fun looking around my lil map!
