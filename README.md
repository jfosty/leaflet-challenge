# Leaflet Challenge 

In this challenge, we are creating a map visualization that shows the magnitude of an earthquake based on the size of the dot. The location and depth is als representated on the map. 

I used github's pages function to create this as an actual webpage that anyone can visit here: https://jfosty.github.io/leaflet-challenge/. 

Have fun looking around my lil map!
